# certificate-authority

Assumption(s):
- Codebases checking out this repo, place it at $HOME/git/certificate-authority.  The scripts included with this repository drive off of this directory. 

- Update this README.  
- Updating all scripts, so they work in location where they currently exist.  I need to figure bash script code that will determine root directory of certificate-authority, on box where it's being ran, then use that when running commands from within these scripts.
- Parameterize scripts, passing in appropriate values
